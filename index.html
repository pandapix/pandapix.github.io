                    <p class="text-muted">We digitize slides using a high-quality digital camera with a macro lens.  For large slide collections, we also use a highly modified Kodak slide projector.  The resulting image quality is equal to or better than scans obtained from high resolution scanners.  
			    <hr>
			    <p class="text-muted">Slides should be clean and in landscape orientation.  You can provide the slides as individual slides in groups (typically 40 slides or more), or loaded into 80-slide carousels.  We can loan 80-slide carousels upon request.  Contact us for more information.  We will be glad to provide sample digitized slides upon request.</p>

					<p class="text-muted">Please note that we do not clean slides, so you'll want to make sure that your slides are clean.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">We transfer your home videos to DVD format.  We will transfer <strong>multiple home videos to a single 2-hour DVD</strong> (most of our competitors limit you to just two videos per DVD!   This can get quite expensive if your videos are less than 30 minutes in length.).  For large conversion jobs, we also offer <strong>FREE estimates.</strong>  In addition, we can <strong>edit</strong> your videos to <strong>increase the volume</strong> (some videos, such as those taken for weddings, graduation ceremonies, etc. have very low, inaudible, or poor audio) or to select specific portions of the videos for a nominal charge.        </p>
					<hr>
					<p class="text-muted">In addition, we provide <strong>FREE AVI digital master files</strong> of your home videos (none of our competitors do this).  These AVI files may be easily played (and edited) on your home computers, smart phones, or tablets.  MP4 files can also be provided for a nominal charge.</p> 
					<hr>	
					<p class="text-muted">We transfer <strong>VHS, VHS-C, Hi-8, Digital 8, and Mini-DV</strong> video cassette formats.  We will also provide an index of your home videos (usually organized by date) to enable you to easily locate your favorite videos.  Although we do not digitize 8mm and other film formats, we will work with other local digitizers so that we can be your one-stop shop for digitizing services.  We can also create a montage of thumbnails of your home videos upon request.</p>

					<hr>
					<p class="text-muted">If you are not sure which negatives you want to convert, you can save money by utilizing a lower cost option. Just insert your negatives into clear plastic negative archival sheets (we can provide these).  We'll take a picture of the archival sheets and convert them to low resolution digital "contact" sheets.  You can then decide which negatives you would like digitized at high resolution.  <a href="/img/Digital Contact Sheet.jpg">(click here for example Digital Contact Sheet)</a>  </p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Paul and Anne Briggs of Lexington, Kentucky, are dedicated to preserving sentimental videos, photos, slides, and negatives in digitized form. This local, family-owned business allows you to hand-deliver your treasured family photos without the worry of packing and shipping. </p>
			<hr>
			<p class="text-muted"> Paul came up with the idea of PandaPix in 2010, initially looking for a way to convert old photos to digital format.  He realized that this would be something that a lot of people would want, and he soon expanded into conversion of home videos, slides, and negatives and other non-digital media. </p>
			</div>
			 <div class="col-md-4">	
			<p class="text-muted"> Need a photo slideshow for your wedding or graduation and running out of time to scan all your old photos? Maybe you're creating a scrapbook for a Christmas gift? Or perhaps you want to email a digitized memory to a friend, but can't. </p>

We offer various ways to efficiently create standard quality digitized files which allow you to keep the conversion costs to an absolute minimum. </p>

					<h4>General</h4>
					<h5>Why should I scan my home videos and photos in the first place? </h5>
					<p>Your home videos, photos, slides, negatives are irreplaceable family treasures which are highly valued at PandaPix. Digitizing your videos, snapshots and memories allows them to be preserved digitally and remotely (in case of a home disaster).  It also protects your videos and pictures from the degradation of time, heat, light, scratching, and color shifting which harm videos and original photos, slides, and negatives.</p><p> Digitizing saves your videos and photos in the state they are in, prior to any further deterioration. In addition, digitizing allows you to readily organize and access and share your memories on your computer, smartphone, or tablet. Converting your old family videos to DVD or digital avi files will allow you to watch your favorite memories long after your camcorder or VHS player has expired or has been replaced by the latest technology.</p>
					<h5>Will my photos be kept confidential?</h5>
					<p>Yes.  Only PandaPix staff will see your photos and videos.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
					<h5>Are my originals returned to me? </h5>
					<p>Of course! Every photo, negative, slide, and video will be handled with tender loving care and will be returned in the same condition as it was delivered to us.</p>
				   <h5>Can I view my photos online?  </h5>
					<p>Yes.  When you pay for your order in full you may view your digitized photos, slides, and negatives online. </p>
					<h5>How long will it take to get my digitized photos/videos back?</h5>
					<p>It depends on the size of your order. As a general rule of thumb, you can expect to have your digitized memories and originals within two weeks of PandaPix receiving them.</p>
					<h5>Is packaged pricing available? </h5>
					<p>Yes! Contact us directly to receive a custom price for your memory digitizing needs.</p>
					<h5>How do I choose a resolution?  </h5>	
					<p>The default resolution for scanned photos is 400 dpi, which will work fine for reprints. All slides and negatives are digitized at high resolution which will allow you to make large prints if desired.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
					<h4>Photos</h4>
						<h5>May I leave my photos in my albums when I drop them off at Pandapix? </h5>
						<p>No. PandaPix scanning prices assume that all photos have been removed from their holders and do not have any sticky residue attached.</p>
						<h5>Can the color of my photos be enhanced?</h5>
						<p>Yes, PandaPix offers digital photo enhancing services.</p>
					<h4>Videos</h4>
						<h5>How many minutes of video fit on a DVD? </h5>
						<p>Standard DVDs store up to 120 minutes of video. PandaPix will transfer up to four ½ hour home videos to one DVD. We also recommend that you have your videos converted to avi format, which may be saved on computers or thumbdrives, and which offers a permanent way to save your videos for future playback.</p>
					<h4>Negatives</h4>
						<h5>Can you digitize old negatives? </h5>
						<p>Yes, one of the unique services PandaPix offers is digitizing of 35mm, 110mm, and medium format negatives.</p>
					<h4>Slides</h4>
						<h5>Can you digitize slides? </h5>
						<p>Yes, PandaPix also offers efficient slide digitization as well. We prefer that you provide us with your slides in carousels. If you don’t have slide carousels, we will loan them to you.</p>

                                <p>“After I lost my lifetime of photos in a flood, I tried a popular online company to restore my 110mm and 35mm negatives.  I was so disappointed in their blurry, out of focus reproductions.  Honestly, the work I got back looked like no one was paying any attention, and my negatives were just being mass reproduced.  Someone suggested trying Pandapix.  I truly could not be more delighted in the excellent job of restoration Pandapix did for me! This company is innovative and worked hard to get me the best product possible from my very old, moisture-exposed negatives.  I wish I had known about this company from the start: honest, innovative, flexible, competitive price, great product, organized digital folders.  I could not be happier with the personal service and attention my photos received!  If you are digitizing old negatives, try this company.  Their quality and service was far superior to others I tried.”</p>

It even came with an index.  The price was a bargain!  I am pleased with the quality.  And the best part?  My family has had hours and hours of fun watching our past.  The children are amazed at what they were like as toddlers.  Thanks to Pandapix, I will be able to copy these files easily for the children as they start leaving home. In a very real way, Pandapix has given my family our history!!"</p>

                                <p>"Thank you for the excellent and fast job you did with the 3 VHS tapes I brought to you about a month ago.  I have reviewed them and they are perfect.  I also appreciate your going above and beyond to have them ready in just a couple of days.  We used them for our 50th Wedding Anniversary and got lots of complements on them.  I will keep your name and business and if I run into anyone else who could use your services, I will refer them to you."</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Home Video Conversion</p>
								<p>"I had about 20 mini dv tapes from an old camcorder that needed to be transferred to digital files. After researching a number of companies that provided this service, I found the prices were a little more than I wanted to spend, plus I felt uneasy about mailing my precious tapes to a company located hundreds of miles away.</p>
									
								<p>Thankfully I kept searching the Internet and came across the Panda Pix web site. I was so pleased to find a local company that could assist. I emailed my request for a free estimate and was very pleasantly surprised to receive a reply within a few hours.</p>
								<p>After an email exchange, I found that their quoted price was extremely reasonable, so I thought I'd give PandaPix a try.</p>
								<p>The customer service provided was quite impressive. When there was a problem with converting my tapes with the video camera Panda Pix had on hand, another video camera was purchased (at no additional cost to me) in order to complete the job. In addition, I was regularly kept abreast of the status of my order. I even received a clip of a video to review as I awaited my order to be completed.</p> 
								<p>Once my tapes had been transferred to digital files and DVDs, I raced home and excitedly viewed each file. To be able to treasure old videos that my family and I haven't seen in 10 years has been such a blessing! Every time I view these videos, it brings me so much joy!</p>
								<p>I highly recommend Panda Pix for their professionalism, workmanship and quality. You will not be disappointed!"</p>
